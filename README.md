# GTC - God Tier Champions
# Ryze Beta with passive logic (Q before WER), private buff logic - faster than EB getbuff, stop aa if W ready, Q before attack if out of attack range
Ryze to do: block spell logic, add stack combos like best damage 1 stack (REQW) etc., better stack logic, check mana and more
# Ashe fastest as possible: reset aa after Q, use Q after attack
